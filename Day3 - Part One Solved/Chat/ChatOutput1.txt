To solve this problem, we can iterate over each rucksack and check if there are any items that appear in both compartments. We can then sum the priorities of these item types and return the result.

Here is some sample Python code that demonstrates how this can be done:

Copy code
def find_errors(rucksacks):
  # Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum of the priorities of the
  # item types that appear in both compartments of each rucksack.
  sum_priorities = 0

  # Iterate over each rucksack.
  for rucksack in rucksacks:
    # Split the rucksack into its two compartments.
    first_compartment = rucksack[:len(rucksack)//2]
    second_compartment = rucksack[len(rucksack)//2:]

    # Check if there are any common items between the two compartments.
    common_items = set(first_compartment) & set(second_compartment)
    if common_items:
      # If there are common items, add their priorities to the sum.
      for item in common_items:
        # Lowercase item types have priorities 1 through 26, while uppercase
        # item types have priorities 27 through 52.
        if item.islower():
          sum_priorities += ord(item) - ord('a') + 1
        else:
          sum_priorities += ord(item) - ord('A') + 27

  # Return the sum of the priorities of the item types that appear in both
  # compartments of each rucksack.
  return sum_priorities

# Test the function with the example input.
rucksacks = ['vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp',
             'jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL',
             'PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg',
             'wMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn',
             'ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT',
             'CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw']
sum_priorities = find_errors(rucksacks)
print(sum_priorities) # Expected output: 157
This should output the correct result of 157 for the given example input.
