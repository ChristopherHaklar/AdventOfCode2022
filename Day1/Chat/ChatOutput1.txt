Here is a possible solution to the problem in Python:

Copy code
# Read the input
calorie_lines = [line.strip() for line in open('calories.txt')]

# Split the input into a list of lists, one for each Elf
elves = []
current_elf = []
for line in calorie_lines:
    if line == '':
        # This is a blank line, indicating the start of a new Elf's inventory
        elves.append(current_elf)
        current_elf = []
    else:
        # This is the calorie count of a food item
        current_elf.append(int(line))

# Add the last Elf's inventory to the list
elves.append(current_elf)

# Find the Elf with the most calories
most_calories = 0
for elf in elves:
    total_calories = sum(elf)
    if total_calories > most_calories:
        most_calories = total_calories

# Print the result
print(f"The Elf with the most calories is carrying {most_calories} calories.")
This solution reads the input from a file called calories.txt, which should contain one line for each food item, with a blank line between each Elf's inventory. It then splits the input into a list of lists, one for each Elf, and calculates the total number of calories for each Elf. Finally, it finds the Elf with the most calories and prints the result.

Note that this solution assumes that the input is well-formed, i.e. that it contains a valid list of calorie counts and that there is at least one Elf. It may not work correctly if the input is invalid or incomplete.
