Here is a python script that takes in the filename of the text file as a command line argument and calculates the total score:

Copy code
import sys

# Function to calculate the score for a single round
def calculate_round_score(opponent_choice, your_choice, outcome):
  # Score for the shape chosen
  shape_score = 0
  if your_choice == "X":
    shape_score = 1
  elif your_choice == "Y":
    shape_score = 2
  elif your_choice == "Z":
    shape_score = 3
  
  # Score for the outcome of the round
  outcome_score = 0
  if outcome == "win":
    outcome_score = 6
  elif outcome == "draw":
    outcome_score = 3
  
  return shape_score + outcome_score

# Function to calculate the total score
def calculate_total_score(strategy_guide):
  total_score = 0
  for line in strategy_guide:
    opponent_choice, your_choice = line.strip().split()
    # Determine the outcome of the round
    if opponent_choice == your_choice:
      outcome = "draw"
    elif (opponent_choice == "A" and your_choice == "Y") or (opponent_choice == "B" and your_choice == "Z") or (opponent_choice == "C" and your_choice == "X"):
      outcome = "win"
    else:
      outcome = "loss"
    total_score += calculate_round_score(opponent_choice, your_choice, outcome)
  return total_score

# Read the strategy guide from the file
filename = sys.argv[1]
with open(filename, "r") as f:
  strategy_guide = f.readlines()

# Calculate and print the total score
total_score = calculate_total_score(strategy_guide)
print("Total score:", total_score)
To use the script, save it to a file (e.g. "calculate_score.py") and run it with the filename of the strategy guide as a command line argument:

Copy code
python calculate_score.py strategy_guide.txt
The script will read the strategy guide from the file, calculate the total score, and print it to the console.
