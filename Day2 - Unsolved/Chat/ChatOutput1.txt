Here is a possible solution in Python:

Copy code
# Read the strategy guide from the file
with open('Input.txt') as f:
    guide = f.read().strip().split('\n')

# Define the scoring rules
rules = {
    'R': {'R': 3, 'P': 0, 'S': 1},
    'P': {'R': 1, 'P': 3, 'S': 0},
    'S': {'R': 0, 'P': 1, 'S': 3},
}

# Define a mapping from letters to hand shapes
mapping = {
    'A': 'R',
    'B': 'P',
    'C': 'S',
    'X': 'R',
    'Y': 'P',
    'Z': 'S',
}

# Define the function that calculates the score for a single round
def score(opponent, player):
    return rules[mapping[opponent]][mapping[player]]

# Initialize the total score to 0
total_score = 0

# Loop over the strategy guide and calculate the score for each round
for line in guide:
    opponent, player = line.split()
    total_score += score(opponent, player)

# Print the total score
print(total_score)
To use this script, save it to a file named solution.py and run it using the command python solution.py. This will print the total score you would get if you were to follow the strategy guide.
